# OBJECTIVE
The intention of this project is to make a virtual book store that feeds on the openlibrary.org web, by connecting to its API. After downloading the necessary information, a results page is displayed that allows you to add the desired number of books to the shopping cart, as long as the required inventory exists. Finally, on the shopping cart page it is possible to modify the order or discard it completely.
